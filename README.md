# HamsterGame

Java Game
You play as Gary the Hamster who walks around and collects seeds. Happy music plays, sound effects, and animation.
There is no end goal -- This can change but unsure about how to further develop this into a game.

This branch was created during the Spring 2017 Hackathon at the University of Arkansas.

Hackathon Theme: Improve upon something existing. 22-hour time constraint.

End result: Hamster open world game with NPC that launch other games. Pathways clear up as games are completed.

Games include:
Tic-Tac-Toe
Galaga
Dance Dance Revolution
Flappy bird

Notes:
Music player for DDR is currently commented out. This works by itself, but there is a bug after integration to the open world that crashes the application.

Future work:
Open world music either needs more songs, or loop infinitely.
Open world music should pause when in another game and resume upon return.
The images on the prompt screen for playing a game can change.
