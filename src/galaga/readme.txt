Overall important instructions:
-------------------------------
1) Once the zip file has been extracted to a folder,
   the shell command 'make' will simply build the project.
   The command 'make run' will make and run the project.
   Lastly, if needed, the command 'make clean' will remove
   any .class files.

2) Five serializable files (.ser extension) have been 
   included in the zip file. The name of each file 
   corresponds to a location in the game. Seeing as the
   game can be quite difficult, if you cannot advance far
   in the game, simply load any of the five files to reach
   a given phase. For instance, once the game has started,
   loading the 'BossPhasePart2' file will load the game
   state beginning at the second part of the boss phase. 

3) This is particularly important and is also included
   in the in-game instructions: Any time a game is loaded,
   it will automatically be in a PAUSED state (because it
   was saved in a paused state). Thus, the game must always
   be manually resumed once loaded.

Enjoy!
